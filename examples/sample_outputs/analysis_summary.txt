AI Architecture Analysis Summary
========================================

Model: gpt-4
Analysis Date: 20240121_143022
Pipeline Version: TIDE v1.0.0 → Pattern Analyzer v2.0.0

KEY FINDINGS:
- Complexity Score: 0.847
- Pattern Richness: 0.923
- Information Density: 0.756
- Unique Patterns: 237
- Resonance Events: 42
- Emergence Indicators: 3

PATTERN INSIGHTS:
- Hierarchical attention structure detected in layers 7-11
- Emergent clustering behavior observed at token boundaries
- Phase transitions correlate with semantic shifts
- Strong harmonic resonance (RP001) dominates layer 11
- Cross-layer interactions suggest distributed processing

MATHEMATICAL FEATURES:
- Network Topology: Scale-free with power-law distribution
- Fractal Dimension: 1.73 (indicating self-similar patterns)
- Primary Eigenvalues: [2.34, 1.89, 1.23, 0.87]
- Spectral Gap: 0.45 (suggesting clear cluster separation)

RECOMMENDATIONS:
• Focus optimization efforts on attention layer 11 (highest resonance)
• Investigate resonance pattern RP001 for potential efficiency gains
• Consider pruning patterns with amplitude < 0.3 (minimal impact)
• Cross-layer interaction RP003 may be key to emergent behavior
• Monitor entropy levels in feed-forward layers for stability

TECHNICAL NOTES:
- All 14 analysis tools executed successfully
- 2 tools (Fourier, Wavelet) used optimized fallbacks
- Total analysis time: 12.3 seconds
- Memory usage: 487 MB peak
