## 🚀 AI Cognitive Pattern Detection Framework

**An experimental framework for analyzing patterns in AI responses** - measuring linguistic features, calculating pattern signatures, and tracking cognitive evolution across responses.

## 📊 What This Actually Does

The pattern analyzer examines AI responses and calculates:

### ✅ Currently Working Features:
- **Pattern Signature Generation**: Creates 4-character codes (e.g., CCDF → CCDR) representing:
  - Neural pathway dominance (Cortical/Thalamic)
  - Information complexity (Simple/Complex)
  - Trust orientation (Cooperative/Defensive)
  - Cognitive style (Flexible/Rigid)

- **Linguistic Feature Analysis**: Measures concrete vs abstract language ratios
- **Response Evolution Tracking**: Compares changes between responses
- **Visualization Generation**: Creates charts showing pattern distributions
- **Neural Pattern Simulation**: Based on linguistic markers (not actual brain scans)

### 🔧 In Development:
- Full integration of 12+ additional analysis tools
- Real-time GitHub Actions workflow
- Multi-model comparison studies
- Expanded feature extraction

## 🧪 Current Data

From our initial analysis of Claude-4-Opus:

| Metric | Response 1 | Response 2 | Change |
|--------|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Pattern Score** | 0.295 | 0.470 | **+59%** |
| **Signature** | CCDF | CCDR | Flexibility→Rigidity |
| **Word Count** | 247 | 244 | -3 |
| **Complexity** | 0.708 | 0.770 | +9% |

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Currently Integrated (2 tools):
- **[Concrete Overflow Detector](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/concrete-overflow-detector)** - Linguistic pattern analysis
- **[Information Atoms](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/information-atoms)** - Information structure analysis

### Ready for Integration (12+ tools):
The analyzer includes fallback methods for these tools, which will be fully integrated:
- Game Theory Trust Suite
- BIND (Boundary Interface Dynamics)
- Hexagonal Pattern Suite
- Cognitive Architectures
- TIDE Framework
- And more...

## 🤝 How to Use

### Quick Start:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/HillaryDanan/pattern-analyzer.git
cd pattern-analyzer

# Install dependencies
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn

# Run analysis
python pattern_analyzer.py

# View results
open index.html
```

### What Gets Analyzed:
- Text length and word count
- Abstract vs concrete language ratios
- Sentence complexity
- Conceptual boundaries
- Trust/cooperation markers
- Information structure metrics

## 🔬 How Pattern Signatures Work

Each response generates a 4-character code:

```
CCDF = Cortical + Complex + Defensive + Flexible
TCSR = Thalamic + Complex + Cooperative + Rigid
```

These signatures help track how AI responses evolve when moving from description to self-reflection tasks.

## 📊 Current Dataset

- **Sessions Analyzed**: 1 (Claude-4-Opus)
- **Unique Signatures Found**: 2 (CCDF, CCDR)
- **Total Measurements**: 50+ per session
- **Development Time**: 5 weeks of intensive work

## 🌟 Key Findings So Far

1. **Pattern Evolution**: AI responses show measurable changes when shifting from external description to self-reflection
2. **Signature Stability**: Initial analysis suggests consistent patterns within models
3. **Complexity Increase**: Self-reflection tends to increase information complexity scores

## 🚀 Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Current):
- [x] Core pattern analysis engine
- [x] Basic linguistic feature extraction
- [x] Pattern signature generation
- [x] Simple visualizations

### Phase 2 (Next):
- [ ] Integrate remaining 12+ tools
- [ ] Expand to multiple AI models
- [ ] Implement real-time analysis
- [ ] Add statistical validation

### Phase 3 (Future):
- [ ] API for automated analysis
- [ ] Comparative studies across models
- [ ] Pattern prediction capabilities
- [ ] Research publication

## 📝 Honest Limitations

- Currently analyzes linguistic patterns, not actual neural activity
- Limited to 1 model so far (more data needed)
- Pattern signatures are experimental and need validation
- Some measurements use fallback calculations
