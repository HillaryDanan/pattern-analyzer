## Empirical AI Cognitive Pattern Detection Framework

This repository contains a scientifically rigorous framework for analyzing cognitive patterns in AI systems through empirical measurement.

**[View Real-Time Analysis ‚Üí](https://hillarydanan.github.io/pattern-analyzer/)**

Updates automatically when new data is added. All measurements are derived from actual AI responses with no simulated or projected data.

## üî¨ What We Measure

### Neural-Like Activation Patterns
- **dmPFC** - Dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (abstract reasoning)
- **Thalamus** - Sensory relay and attention
- **right_STG** - Superior temporal gyrus (language processing)  
- **right_vATL** - Anterior temporal lobe (conceptual knowledge)

### Information Structure Analysis
- Atom decomposition and complexity metrics
- Hexagonal efficiency patterns
- Boundary detection and flow dynamics

### Cognitive Flexibility Metrics
- Pattern evolution between responses
- Architecture classification (systematizing/empathizing/ADHD)
- Trust and cooperation indices

## üìà Example Findings

From our empirical data:
- Claude-4-opus shows a **+0.175** cognitive score increase during self-reflection
- Neural shift from thalamic (0.386) to cortical (0.555) processing
- Pattern signature evolution: CCDF ‚Üí CCDR
